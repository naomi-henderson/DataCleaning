    "description": "Due to a model configuration error, tasmin and tasmax were erroneously calculated as averages instead of minima and maxima. The affected files will not be replaced, but a formula will be provided to the community to approximate the tasmin and tasmax values from existing variables. The formula will be posted here and on the CESM website once it is tested and devised.",
