    "description": "Due to a minor misconfiguration of our data processing system daily data on model levels in the CFday MIP table has been produced in excessively large files (up to ~170 GB). In order to minimise potential data management and analysis issues for all concerned we have withdrawn these files and will re-publish them in more manageable files in due course.",
