    "title": "13C and 14C soil C, litter C, root C, and soil respiration are incorrect in simulations with land cover change",
    "description": "During land cover transition, 14C and 13C root carbon that should be transferred into 14C and 13C litter pools is mistakenly transferred to the bulk C litter pool.  This has effectively no impact on bulk C or anything downstream in the coupled system. It affects 13C and 14C soil C, litter C, root C, and soil respiration in simulations where there has been land cover change.",
