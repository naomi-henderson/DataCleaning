    "title": "Incorrect latitude & longitude coordinate data in some Omon datasets",
    "description": "Due to a processing system error the latitude and longitude data being written to the published files is incorrect and may be up to half a degree out. Data that should have been given latitudes and longitudes corresponding to the T points of the eORCA1 grid was instead given coordinate values for the U or V points (or vice-versa) depending on processing order.  Affected data has been withdrawn and replacement data sets will be published in due course.",
