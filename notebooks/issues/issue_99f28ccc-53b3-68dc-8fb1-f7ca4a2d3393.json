    "description": "Within the conversion from CESM's CAM precipitation units (m s-1) to CMIP's units of (kg m-2 s-1) an incorrect scaling factor was applied. The conversion should have been to multiply CAM's values by 1000 kg m-3. Instead, the values were multiplied by 1000 and then divided by 86400, resulting in values that are too small.",
