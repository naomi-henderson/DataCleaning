    "description": "Some ESM4 snc output was incorrectly calculated. During processing, snc reported as a fraction of land area was re-normalized to the Data Request-specified fraction of grid cell area (by multiplying by land area fraction). As a result of a processing error, some ESM4 output was normalized twice, resulting in incorrect data. Affected data will be withdrawn and republished.",
